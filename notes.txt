	.Inline navbar with some padding
	.Edit title style on home page
 
 
> Challenge
Problem -> I used a linear-gradient(180deg) to style the page so it was not just a white page. The gradient styling on the Home page and Tushonka page was not working properly.

	Note -> I believe this had something to do with the fact that there was only a small amount of content on each of those pages, making the gradient style “reset” half-way down the page

SOLUTION: Gave the body element for the Home page and Tushonka page an id=”container” so I could change the view height to 100. Gradient does not “reset” half-way down the page anymore.


    #container {
        height: 100vh;
    }
